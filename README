# FP-growth
This repository contains my C++ implementation of the well-known **FP-growth** algorithm.  
I publish the code in the hope that it will be useful. I carefully tested the code on three different samples and results were checked against [this implementation](http://www.borgelt.net/fpgrowth.html) of the algorithm, but please don't assume the code is completely bug-free.

The files `fptree.hpp` and `fptree.cpp` contain the data structures and the algorithm, the file `main.cpp` contains a bunch of tests.

The code is written using features of C++11, so compile it using the appropriate options (e.g. `-std=c++11`).

Happy coding! :v:
